## Software Developer
### ✨Go-Getter, Team Player & Self-Professed Ideator✨
</br>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on personal apps, portfolio projects, and *DXC* things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Spring Boot and patience.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Full-Stack projects, as well as any and all other interesting things permitted by law.
- 💡 My previous professional experience has been in new business development and product management.

</br>

- 💻 As a dev, I'm adaptive, a quick-learner, creative, flexible, *a bit pedantic*, and a good communicator.
- 👨‍💻 As a pro, I'm dedicated, hard-working, and an innovative-thinker.

</br>

- 💬 As a "me", I love me some arthouse films, gourmet food, and hide-and-seek in large spaces.
